### Problem Statement Addressed: 
    4. Find Novel Drug Treatments

### Description: 

Drugs and other medical treatments are approved in carefully controlled clinical trials that are designed to answer very narrow questions about the safety and efficacy of those treatments for very specific conditions and patient groups. However, treatments are often effective for a wider range of uses than what they are officially approved for. Such “off label” usage is common.

Off-label prescribing isn't necessarily bad. It can be beneficial, especially when patients have exhausted all other approved options, as may be the case with rare diseases or cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, cancer treatment often involves using certain chemotherapy drugs off-label, because a chemotherapy drug approved for one type of cancer may actually target many different types of tumors. Off-label use of a drug or combination of drugs often represents the standard of care.

### How Nodblix Utilizes Graph Technology

Leveraging graph analytics approaches can provide a powerful accelerator to complex data structure representations and speed understanding of complex relationships between drugs, symptoms, genes, diseases and more, acting as a catalyst to identify opportunities. Applied to pharmaceutical research, a graph like Nodblix provide a framework to take advantage of huge libraries of prospective drugs and isolate which compounds could be functionally relevant. Tigergraph allowed us to model biological complexity in detail and thereby will make drug discovery more efficient and economical for researchers and medical professionals.

## Installation [Nodblix]

Please give detailed instructions on installing, configuring, and running the project so judges can fully replicate and assess it. 

This can include:
1. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/dhruvilp/nodblix-vercel`
2. Install dependencies: Please get started here: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
3. Access data: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results 
4. Steps to build/run project: Once Flutter is installed on your machine, run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`. Then, `flutter run -d chrome` to the web version of Nodblix app. Also, you may run the same source code on Android, iOS, macOS, and WindowsOS platforms as wished.

## Getting Started with Flutter

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Known Issues and Future Improvements

We'd love to incorporate more diverse data into our graph so we can explore even more connections and patterns between health conditions and drug compounds. Also, this was our first time using a graph database so we tried our best to both understand the Tigergraph and how to make it work with our project topic.  

## Reflections

Tigergraph challenges has indeed been a great learning experience for both of us.
